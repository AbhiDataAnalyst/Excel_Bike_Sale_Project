# Excel_Bike_Sale_Project
Hello, I worked on a excel project to analyse Bike sales
First of all i was started to clean the data by removing duplicated.

My data including columns like Marital Status, Gender, Income, Age Etc...
Marital Status column has data like M (Married),S (Single) & gender column lik F (Female), M (Male)
Using find & replce i was replaced its full form.

I wanna change the age to some categories or groups to make visualizatio easier.
for that i was created Age group like <31 as Adulthood, >31 as Middle Age & >51 as Old

Then i was created Pivot table compared gender, Commute Distance & Age group with Bike sales
also created some attractive Charts to visualize the data in a very understandable manner.
added slicer om Marital status, Education, Region and 'report connection' to connect multiple charts.

Finally created a attractive and simple understanding Dashboard.

Findings-
  Based on my insight i found that When income of a person increase chance to buy a bike is more
and most of them are Males.

  A person who travelling for short distance bought bike more than a person travelling  large distance.
That means if the commute distance is less then they mostly buy bike.

  Middle Age group will bought bike than other age groups. married persons bought bike than Single one

So like these so much information can get through this Dashboard.
